### 03:11 06/06/2019

just launched the project (again because I'm retarded)

Created:
*   .env for secret data
*   File structure
*   MongoDB model (User(guild specific))
*   Ready event
*   .gitignore (git)

Began with:
*   Warn command

Notes for next time:
Complete the warn command. Test it and make sure db is working correctly.

Finished the Warn command and fixed db model issues.

### 22:59 06/06/2019

Found bug in warn command. It does not kick the user after three warnings.
